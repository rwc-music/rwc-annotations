# History

- Basis are the AIST annotations
- 2025/10: (Stefan Balke and Arda Özgün)
    - Merged the updated annotations from https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this_annotations/tree/main/rwc/annotations/beats
    - Original AIST annotations were parsed and saved in the "beat_this" annotations format to make both comparable
    - Both versions were sonified and quality checked
    - If differences arose, we created a new pull request per track
    - Per track, we either decided completely for the new or original annotation, merged both, and/or corrected the results
